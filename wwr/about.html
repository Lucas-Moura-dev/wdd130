            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Down the River was founded with one clear mission: to share the thrill, beauty, and freedom of the river
                with everyone
                who dares to paddle along. What began as a small group of river enthusiasts has grown into a passionate
                team dedicated
                to creating unforgettable rafting adventures.

                From our first trips, we knew the river had something special to teach—about teamwork, about respecting
                nature, and
                about embracing the unexpected turns along the way. Over the years, Down the River has guided countless
                adventurers
                through calm waters, exciting rapids, and breathtaking landscapes, always with a commitment to safety
                and unforgettable
                experiences.</p>
            <p>Today, Down the River is proud to be more than a rafting company—we are a community of explorers, nature
                lovers, and
                storytellers. Every trip down the river is not just about reaching the end, but about the journey, the
                laughter, and the
                stories made along the way.</p>
