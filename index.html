        <p>Welcome to my personal homepage. As you saw in the title My name is Lucas Moura and I am a student in WDD
            130. I'm from Ceará, Brazil, and Actually I'm working as Technical Supervisor in a footwear company, but I
            want to follow another path, as a Software
            developer for this reason I'm currently studying web development. I have some experience with HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, Python and sql database. Actually I am working in a new project thats automate machines
            monitoring and creating
            efficiency reports. I really like my job, but I feel that I can grow more in this development area. In my
            free time, I like to gaming and watch movies. Some of my favorites places in my country are Gramado and
            Jericoacoara because of their natural beauty and tourist attractions. For example, the stunning beaches and
            unique rock formations of Jericoacoara. The cold weather and beautiful landscapes make Gramado a good place
            to visit, for example the Crooked Road, is a good place to take photos and enjoy the scenery. In my city
            there are also many interesting places to explore.</p>

        <p>Brazil is known for its vibrant culture, beautiful landscapes, and iconic landmarks like the Cristo Redentor
            statue in Rio de Janeiro. The statue is a symbol of Christianity and a cultural icon of Brazil. The statue
            is located at the top of Corcovado Mountain and offers breathtaking views of the city. It's 38 meters tall
            and made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.</p>
