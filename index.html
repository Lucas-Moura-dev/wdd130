            <p>Welcome to my personal homepage. As you saw in the title My name is Lucas Moura and I am a student in WDD
                130. I'm from Ceará, Brazil, and Actually I'm working as Technical Supervisor in a footwear company, but
                I
                want to follow another path, as a Software
                developer for this reason I'm currently studying web development. I have some experience with HTML, CSS,
                and
                JavaScript, Python and sql database. Actually I am working in a new project thats automate machines
                monitoring and creating
                efficiency reports. I really like my job, but I feel that I can grow more in this development area. In
                my
                free time, I like to gaming and watch movies. Some of my favorites places in my country are Gramado and
                Jericoacoara because of their natural beauty and tourist attractions. For example, the stunning beaches
                and
                unique rock formations of Jericoacoara. The cold weather and beautiful landscapes make Gramado a good
                place
                to visit, for example the Crooked Road, is a good place to take photos and enjoy the scenery. In my city
                there are also many interesting places to explore.</p>

            <h2>Brazil</h2>
            <img src="images/cristo_redentor_rio.jpg" alt="Cristo Redentor in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil" width="200">
            <p>Brazil is known for its vibrant culture, diverse traditions, and stunning natural landscapes that range
                from the Amazon
                rainforest to the white-sand beaches of the Atlantic coast. Among its many landmarks, one of the most
                iconic is the
                Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) statue in Rio de Janeiro, a global symbol of both Christianity and
                Brazilian
                identity.

                Completed in 1931 after nearly a decade of planning and construction, the statue was designed by
                Brazilian engineer
                Heitor da Silva Costa and sculpted by French artist Paul Landowski, with Romanian sculptor Gheorghe
                Leonida contributing
                the detailed face. Standing 38 meters tall with arms stretching 28 meters wide, it is made of reinforced
                concrete and
                covered in soapstone tiles, chosen for their durability and smooth finish.

                Located at the summit of Corcovado Mountain in Tijuca National Park, the monument attracts millions of
                visitors each
                year who come to admire its grandeur and enjoy sweeping views of Rio, including Sugarloaf Mountain,
                Copacabana Beach,
                and Guanabara Bay.
