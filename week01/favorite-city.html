    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <h2>
        <p>My favorite city is Gramado, in the south of Brazil. I love this city because it has a lot of beautiful
            places to
            visit, like parks, gardens, and museums. The architecture is also very charming, with many buildings
            inspired by
            European styles.</p>
    </h2>
    <h3>
        <p>My favorite part of Gramado is the famous "rua torta" or in english "crooked Street". This street is very
            curious
            because is very straight, and has many curves. It is a popular tourist attraction and a great place to take
            photos.</p>
